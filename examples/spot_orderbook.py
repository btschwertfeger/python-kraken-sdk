**For websocket API v2**

This module provides an example on how to use the Spot Orderbook client of the
python-kraken-sdk (https://github.com/btschwertfeger/python-kraken-sdk) to
retrieve and maintain a valid Spot order book for (a) specific asset pair(s).
It can be run directly without any credentials if the python-kraken-sdk is
installed.

    python3 -m pip install python-kraken-sdk

The output when running this snippet looks like the following table and updates
the book as soon as Kraken sent any order book update.

Bid         Volume               Ask         Volume

27071.50000 (0.07194657)         27083.80000 (2.76918992)

This can be the basis of an order book based trading strategy where realtime
data and fast price movements are considered.
