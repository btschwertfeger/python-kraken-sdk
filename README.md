# üìç Command-line interface

The python-kraken-sdk provides a command-line interface to access the Kraken API
using basic instructions while performing authentication tasks in the
background. The Spot and Futures API are accessible and follow the pattern
`kraken {spot,futures} [OPTIONS] URL`. See examples below.

```bash
# get server time
kraken spot https://api.kraken.com/0/public/Time
{'unixtime': 1716707589, 'rfc1123': 'Sun, 26 May 24 07:13:09 +0000'}

# get user's balances
kraken spot --api-key=<api-key> --secret-key=<secret-key> -X POST https://api.kraken.com/0/private/Balance
{'ATOM': '17.28229999', 'BCH': '0.0000077100', 'ZUSD': '1000.0000'}

# get user's trade balances
kraken spot --api-key=<api-key> --secret-key=<secret-key> -X POST https://api.kraken.com/0/private/TradeBalance --data '{"asset": "DOT"}'
{'eb': '2.8987347115', 'tb': '1.1694303513', 'm': '0.0000000000', 'uv': '0', 'n': '0.0000000000', 'c': '0.0000000000', 'v': '0.0000000000', 'e': '1.1694303513', 'mf': '1.1694303513'}

# get 1D candles for a futures instrument

{'result': 'success', 'openPositions': [], 'serverTime': '2024-05-26T07:15:38.91Z'}
```

... All endpoints of the Kraken Spot and Futurs API can be accessed like that.

<a name="spotusage"></a>

# üìç Spot Clients

The python-kraken-sdk provides lots of functions to easily access most of the
REST and websocket endpoints of the Kraken Cryptocurrency Exchange API. Since
these endpoints and their parameters may change, all implemented endpoints are
tested on a regular basis.

The Kraken Spot API can be accessed by executing requests to the endpoints
directly using the `request` method provided by any client. This is demonstrated
below.

See https://docs.kraken.com/api/docs/guides/global-intro for information about
the available endpoints and their usage.

### `SpotClient`

The Spot client provides access to all un-and authenticated endpoints of
Kraken's Spot API.

```python
from kraken.spot import SpotClient

client = SpotClient(key="<your-api-key>", secret="<your-secret-key>")
print(client.request("POST", "/0/private/Balance"))
```

### `SpotAsyncClient`

The async Spot client allows for asynchronous access to Kraken's Spot API
endpoints. Below are two examples demonstrating its usage.

Using SpotAsyncClient without a context manager; In this example, the client is
manually closed after the request is made.

```python
import asyncio
from kraken.spot import SpotAsyncClient

async def main():
    client = SpotAsyncClient(key="<your-api-key>", secret="<your-secret-key>")
    try:
        response = await client.request("POST", "/0/private/Balance")
        print(response)
    finally:
        await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Using SpotAsyncClient as a context manager; This example demonstrates the use of
the context manager, which ensures the client is automatically closed after the
request is completed.

```python
import asyncio
from kraken.spot import SpotAsyncClient

async def main():
    async with SpotAsyncClient(key="<your-api-key>", secret="<your-secret-key>") as client:
        response = await client.request("POST", "/0/private/Balance")
        print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

<a name="spotws"></a>

### `SpotWSClient` (Websocket API)

Kraken offers two versions of their websocket API (V1 and V2). Since V2 is
offers more possibilities, is way faster and easier to use, only the never
version is supported by this SDK.

The official documentation for can be found at:

- https://docs.kraken.com/api/docs/guides/global-intro
- https://docs.kraken.com/websockets-v2

Note that authenticated Spot websocket clients can also un-/subscribe from/to
public feeds.

The example below can be found in an extended way in
`examples/spot_ws_examples.py`.

```python
import asyncio
from kraken.spot import SpotWSClient

class Client(SpotWSClient):
    """Can be used to create a custom trading strategy"""

    async def on_message(self, message):
        """Receives the websocket messages"""
        if message.get("method") == "pong" \
            or message.get("channel") == "heartbeat":
            return

        print(message)
        # Here we can access lots of methods, for example to create an order:
        # if self.is_auth:  # only if the client is authenticated ‚Ä¶
        #     await self.send_message(
        #         message={
        #             "method": "add_order",
        #             "params": {
        #                 "limit_price": 1234.56,
        #                 "order_type": "limit",
        #                 "order_userref": 123456789,
        #                 "order_qty": 1.0,
        #                 "side": "buy",
        #                 "symbol": "BTC/USD",
        #                 "validate": True,
        #             },
        #         }
        #     )
        # ‚Ä¶ it is also possible to call regular REST endpoints
        # but using the websocket messages is more efficient.
        # You can also un-/subscribe here using self.subscribe/self.unsubscribe.

async def main():
    try:
        # Public/unauthenticated websocket client
        client = Client()  # only use this one if you don't need private feeds
        await client.start()
        await client.subscribe(
            params={"channel": "ticker", "symbol": ["BTC/USD", "DOT/USD"]}
        )
        await client.subscribe(
            params={"channel": "book", "depth": 25, "symbol": ["BTC/USD"]}
        )
        # wait because unsubscribing is faster than unsubscribing ‚Ä¶ (just for that example)
        await asyncio.sleep(3)
        # print(client.active_public_subscriptions) # to list active subscriptions
        await client.unsubscribe(
            params={"channel": "ticker", "symbol": ["BTC/USD", "DOT/USD"]}
        )
        # ‚Ä¶

        # AS default, the authenticated client starts two websocket connections,
        # one for authenticated and one for public messages. If there is no need
        # for a public connection, it can be disabled using the ``no_public``
        # parameter.
        client_auth = Client(key="api-key", secret="secret-key", no_public=True)
        await client_auth.start()
        await client_auth.subscribe(params={"channel": "balances"})

        while not client.exception_occur and not client_auth.exception_occur:
            await asyncio.sleep(6)
    finally:
        await client.close()
        await client_auth.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

# üìç Futures Clients

The Kraken Spot API can be accessed by executing requests to the endpoints
directly using the `request` method provided by any client. This is demonstrated
below.

See https://docs.kraken.com/api/docs/guides/global-intro for information about
the available endpoints and their usage.

### `FuturesClient`

The simple Futures client provides access to all un-and authenticated endpoints.

```python
from kraken.futures import FuturesClient

client = FuturesClient(key="<your-api-key>", secret="<your-secret-key>")
print(client.request("GET", "/derivatives/api/v3/accounts"))
```

### `FuturesAsyncClient`

The async Futures client allows for asynchronous access to Kraken's Futures
endpoints. Below are two examples demonstrating its usage.

Using FuturesAsyncClient without a context manager; In this example, the client
is manually closed after the request is made.

```python
import asyncio
from kraken.futures import FuturesAsyncClient

async def main():
    client = FuturesAsyncClient(key="<your-api-key>", secret="<your-secret-key>")
    try:
        response = await client.request("GET", "/derivatives/api/v3/accounts")
        print(response)
    finally:
        await client.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Using FuturesAsyncClient as context manager; This example demonstrates the use
of the context manager, which ensures the client is automatically closed after
the request is completed.

```python
import asyncio
from kraken.futures import FuturesAsyncClient

async def main():
    async with FuturesAsyncClient(key="<your-api-key>", secret="<your-secret-key>") as client:
        response = await client.request("GET", "/derivatives/api/v3/accounts")
        print(response)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### `FuturesWSClient` (Websocket API)

Not only REST, also the websocket API for Kraken Futures is available. Examples
are shown below and demonstrated in `examples/futures_ws_examples.py`.

- https://docs.futures.kraken.com/#websocket-api

Note: Authenticated Futures websocket clients can also un-/subscribe from/to
public feeds.

```python
import asyncio
from kraken.futures import FuturesWSClient

class Client(FuturesWSClient):

    async def on_message(self, event):
        print(event)

async def main():
    try:
        # Public/unauthenticated websocket connection
        client = Client()
        await client.start()

        products = ["PI_XBTUSD", "PF_ETHUSD"]

        # subscribe to a public websocket feed
        await client.subscribe(feed="ticker", products=products)
        # await client.subscribe(feed="book", products=products)
        # ‚Ä¶

        # unsubscribe from a public websocket feed
        # await client.unsubscribe(feed="ticker", products=products)

        # Private/authenticated websocket connection (+public)
        client_auth = Client(key="key-key", secret="secret-key")
        await client_auth.start()

        # print(client_auth.get_available_private_subscription_feeds())

        # subscribe to a private/authenticated websocket feed
        await client_auth.subscribe(feed="fills")
        await client_auth.subscribe(feed="open_positions")
        await client_auth.subscribe(feed="open_orders")
        # ‚Ä¶

        # unsubscribe from a private/authenticated websocket feed
        await client_auth.unsubscribe(feed="fills")

        while not client.exception_occur and not client_auth.exception_occur:
            await asyncio.sleep(6)
    finally:
        await client.close()
        await client_auth.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

# üÜï Contributions

‚Ä¶ are welcome - but:

- First check if there is an existing issue or PR that addresses your
  problem/solution. If not - create one first - before creating a PR.
- Typo fixes, project configuration, CI, documentation or style/formatting PRs
  will be rejected. Please create an issue for that.
- PRs must provide a reasonable, easy to understand and maintain solution for an
  existing problem. You may want to propose a solution when creating the issue
  to discuss the approach before creating a PR.
- Please have a look at [CONTRIBUTION.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

<a name="trouble"></a>

# üö® Troubleshooting

- Check if you downloaded and installed the **latest version** of the
  python-kraken-sdk.
- Check the **permissions of your API keys** and the required permissions on the
  respective endpoints.
- If you get some Cloudflare or **rate limit errors**, please check your Kraken
  Tier level and maybe apply for a higher rank if required.
- **Use different API keys for different algorithms**, because the nonce
  calculation is based on timestamps and a sent nonce must always be the highest
  nonce ever sent of that API key. Having multiple algorithms using the same
  keys will result in invalid nonce errors.
- Always keep an eye on https://status.kraken.com/ when encountering
  connectivity problems.

<a name="notes"></a>

# üìù Notes

The versioning scheme follows the pattern `v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>`. Here's
what each part signifies:

- **Major**: This denotes significant changes that may introduce new features or
  modify existing ones. It's possible for these changes to be breaking, meaning
  backward compatibility is not guaranteed. To avoid unexpected behavior, it's
  advisable to specify at least the major version when pinning dependencies.
- **Minor**: This level indicates additions of new features or extensions to
  existing ones. Typically, these changes do not break existing implementations.
- **Patch**: Here, you'll find bug fixes, documentation updates, and changes
  related to continuous integration (CI). These updates are intended to enhance
  stability and reliability without altering existing functionality.

Coding standards are not always followed to make arguments and function names as
similar as possible to those of the Kraken API documentations.

<a name="considerations"></a>

# Considerations

The tool aims to be fast, easy to use and maintain. In the past, lots of clients
were implemented, that provided functions for almost all available endpoints of
the Kraken API. The effort to maintain this collection grew to a level where it
was not possible to check various changelogs to apply new updates on a regular
basis. Instead, it was decided to concentrate on the `request` functions of
the `SpotClient`, `SpotAsyncClient`, `FuturesClient` and the
`FuturesAsyncClient` (as well as their websocket client implementations). All
those clients named "User", "Trade", "Market", "Funding" and so on will no
longer be extended, but maintained to a certain degree.
