# Welcome to python-kraken-sdk contributing guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to the python-kraken-sdk project! 🔥

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

## Getting started 🚀

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you have an issue that's not yet listed in the troubleshooting section of [README.md](https://github.com/btschwertfeger/python-kraken-sdk#readme) or in [documentation](https://python-kraken-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/stable), feel free to create a new [issue](https://github.com/btschwertfeger/python-kraken-sdk/issues) if there is no similar one listed among the existing ones. Also, for any features that are missing, this is the right place to request them.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/github/docs/issues) to find one that interests you. If the future brings more and more features or issues - you can also filter for specific `labels`.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btschwertfeger/python-kraken-sdk.git
```

2. Install the provided [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks within the repository:

```bash
python-kraken-sdk~$: pre-commit install
```

Make sure that all hooks run through, before pushing changes!

3. Create a new branch and start implementing your changes

### Commit your updates

Once you're happy or reached some minor goal - commit the changes. Please take care to address **all** requirements of the [self-review checklist](./.github/self-review.md) before creating a PR to speed up the review process. ⚡️

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request.

- All checks of the [self-review checklist](./.github/self-review.md) must be addressed.
- Don't forget to link PR to an issue or create one to link if there is no existing issue.
- You may asked for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using _suggested changes_ or pull request _comments_. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.

### Your PR is merged!

Great! We're happy and proud of any contribution made on this project. So you may want to start to work on the next issue? 🔥
